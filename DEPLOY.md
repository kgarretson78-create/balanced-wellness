# Balanced Wellness Medical Spa — Railway Deployment Guide

## Architecture
One Railway service handles everything:
- `npm run build` → Vite builds React to /dist/ + TSC compiles Express to /dist-server/
- `npm start` → Serves React frontend + KelliAI API on same port

---

## Step 1 — Push to GitHub

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Balanced Wellness + KelliAI initial deploy"
# Create repo at github.com, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/balanced-wellness.git
git push -u origin main
```

---

## Step 2 — Create Railway project

1. Go to railway.app → Sign in with GitHub
2. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Select your balanced-wellness repo
4. Railway auto-detects Node.js and reads railway.json

---

## Step 3 — Add environment variables

In Railway dashboard → your service → Variables tab:

| Variable | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | From console.anthropic.com — REQUIRED for KelliAI chat |
| `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` | From elevenlabs.io — for KelliAI voice |
| `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID` | From your ElevenLabs voice library |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Added automatically when you add Postgres (Step 4) |
| `ADMIN_API_KEY` | Any secret string — protects /api/kelliai/leads |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` | CORS allowlist. Set to `https://www.balancedmedicalspa.com` in prod (default `*`) |
| `CANONICAL_HOST` | Canonical host. Default `www.balancedmedicalspa.com`. The server 301s the non-canonical variant (apex or `www.*`) to this host |
| `VITE_API_URL` | **Build-time only.** Leave unset to use the same-origin `/api` routes. Set to an absolute URL (no trailing slash) if KelliAI is hosted separately, e.g. `https://kelliai.balancedmedicalspa.com/api` |
| `VITE_PODIUM_BOOKING_URL_KINGSPORT` | **Build-time only.** Optional override for the Kingsport Podium scheduling URL. Defaults to `https://booking.podium.com/medspa/01930831-564b-7342-98d8-620e43a707e7` (hardcoded in `src/lib/booking.ts`). |
| `VITE_PODIUM_BOOKING_URL_JONESBOROUGH` | **Build-time only.** Optional override for the Jonesborough Podium scheduling URL. Defaults to `https://booking.podium.com/medspa/019c25c3-bfb8-7652-9b53-3b7f41adc505` (hardcoded in `src/lib/booking.ts`). |
| `VITE_PODIUM_BOOKING_URL` | **Build-time only.** Optional shared/fallback scheduling URL. Used only if a location has no per-location default and no per-location env var. |
| `VITE_REFILL_PORTAL_URL` | **Build-time only.** Exact Balanced Wellness Refill.co telehealth portal URL. **No hardcoded default** — until this is set, generic telehealth CTAs route to `/online-care`. |
| `VITE_REFILL_PORTAL_ENABLED` | **Build-time only.** Optional. Defaults to enabled when a valid `VITE_REFILL_PORTAL_URL` is set. Set to `false` to disable the portal CTAs without removing the URL. |
| `VITE_REFILL_ASSESSMENT_WEIGHT_LOSS` | **Build-time only.** Optional. Refill.co assessment URL for the Online Weight Loss card on `/online-care`. Empty → card falls back to `/book-now`. |
| `VITE_REFILL_ASSESSMENT_PEPTIDES` | **Build-time only.** Optional override for the Peptide Therapy assessment URL. Ships with a real hardcoded default in `src/lib/booking.ts`. |
| `VITE_REFILL_ASSESSMENT_SKINCARE` | **Build-time only.** Optional. Refill.co assessment URL for the Online Skincare card. Empty → card falls back to `/book-now`. |
| `VITE_REFILL_ASSESSMENT_WOMENS_HEALTH` | **Build-time only.** Optional. Refill.co assessment URL for the Women's Health card. Empty → card falls back to `/book-now`. |
| `VITE_REFILL_ASSESSMENT_MENS_HEALTH` | **Build-time only.** Optional. Refill.co assessment URL for the Men's Health card. Empty → card falls back to `/book-now`. |

Railway sets PORT automatically — do not set it manually.

### Booking / location chooser

Every "Book Now" / "Book Consultation" CTA on the site opens a **location chooser** dialog
that asks the user to pick **Kingsport** or **Jonesborough**, then opens that location's
scheduling URL in a new tab. The user's choice is also stored in `localStorage` and
attached to KelliAI / contact-form lead submissions as `preferredLocation` so the team
knows which clinic to route follow-up to.

URLs are resolved at build time. Each location has a real, dedicated Podium calendar
hardcoded as a default in `src/lib/booking.ts`:

- **Kingsport** → `https://booking.podium.com/medspa/01930831-564b-7342-98d8-620e43a707e7`
- **Jonesborough** → `https://booking.podium.com/medspa/019c25c3-bfb8-7652-9b53-3b7f41adc505`

Resolution order per location:

1. `VITE_PODIUM_BOOKING_URL_<LOCATION>` env var (per-location override in Railway)
2. The hardcoded default above
3. `VITE_PODIUM_BOOKING_URL` (shared fallback)

To swap a location's URL without a code change, set the corresponding per-location
env var in Railway → Variables and redeploy (these are build-time, so a rebuild is
required).

#### Social booking link

`/book-now` (alias `/social-booking`) is a mobile-first landing page that shows the
Kingsport / Jonesborough chooser and routes each card straight to that location's
Podium scheduler. It also forwards any UTM/query params from the social link through
to Podium so attribution is preserved. Use this as the Instagram / Facebook / TikTok
bio link:

```
https://www.balancedmedicalspa.com/book-now
```

### Online Care & Telehealth (Refill.co)

`/online-care` (aliases `/telehealth`, `/online-telehealth`) is a guided hub that shows
one card per service category — **Online Weight Loss, Peptide Therapy, Online Skincare,
Women's Health, Men's Health**. Every generic telehealth CTA across the site routes to
`/online-care`, which is always a safe internal destination.

Each card links to a Refill.co assessment when a valid URL is configured; otherwise it
falls back to `/book-now`. Assessment URLs are resolved at build time per category:

1. `VITE_REFILL_ASSESSMENT_<CATEGORY>` env var (per-category override in Railway)
2. The hardcoded default in `src/lib/booking.ts` (`ASSESSMENT_DEFAULTS`)
3. Empty → the card falls back to `/book-now`

Only the **Peptide Therapy** assessment ships with a real hardcoded default; all other
categories are empty until a real link is added (in Railway or `ASSESSMENT_DEFAULTS`). To
add a future link, set the matching env var **or** edit one line in `ASSESSMENT_DEFAULTS`.

The legacy `VITE_REFILL_PORTAL_URL` still drives any generic single-portal redirect, but
the primary entry point is now the `/online-care` hub.

All online-care copy is intentionally conservative: a provider reviews every request, no
diagnosis is made online, eligibility is never guaranteed, and emergencies are directed to
call 911 or visit urgent care.

Matching local SEO/AEO pages are prerendered for each category:
`/online-weight-loss-kingsport-tn`, `/peptide-therapy-kingsport-tn`,
`/online-skincare-kingsport-tn`, `/womens-health-kingsport-tn`,
`/mens-health-kingsport-tn`.

### KelliAI integration

The KelliAI chat widget posts to `${VITE_API_URL || "/api"}/kelliai/chat`. By default it calls the routes
served by this same Express process (see `server/routes/kelliai.ts`), so no extra wiring is needed.

If you ever split KelliAI into its own service (e.g. the standalone repo at
`https://github.com/kgarretson78-create/KelliAI`), set `VITE_API_URL` at **build time** in Railway and
point it at that service's `/api` base. No secrets are baked into the bundle — only the URL.

## Step 4 — Add Postgres (for lead capture)

1. In your Railway project → "+ New" → "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
2. Railway creates DB and auto-injects DATABASE_URL into your service
3. The server creates the kelli_leads table automatically on first boot

KelliAI chat and voice work without Postgres — only lead saving requires it.

---

## Step 5 — Custom domain

Railway dashboard → Settings → Domains → Add Custom Domain. Add **both**:

- `balancedmedicalspa.com` (apex)
- `www.balancedmedicalspa.com`

Point your DNS:
- Apex `balancedmedicalspa.com` → Railway-provided CNAME/ALIAS (use ALIAS/ANAME if your DNS supports it; Cloudflare flattens CNAME at apex automatically)
- `www` → CNAME to the same Railway target

SSL is automatic. The Express server 301-redirects the non-canonical variant to `CANONICAL_HOST` (default `www.balancedmedicalspa.com`), so Google sees a single canonical origin. The `<link rel="canonical">` tag in `index.html` and the dynamic SEO component reinforce this.

## Verify after deploy

- your-url.railway.app/ → Website loads
- your-url.railway.app/health → {"status":"ok"}
- your-url.railway.app/robots.txt → plain text with sitemap reference
- your-url.railway.app/sitemap.xml → valid XML sitemap
- https://balancedmedicalspa.com → 301 → https://www.balancedmedicalspa.com
